# SVUI-Temp
Temporary Repository for SuperVillain UI fixes until Munglunch/failcoder returns from absence.

## How to use
As this is non-offical (at present) I'm not publishing updates via curse and/or wowinterface. You have to do some of the hard work which Curse Client and/or Minion normally do :) 

To use, do as follows: 

	* Make sure WoW isn't running 
	* Go to your WoW "Interface\Addons" folder (Normally this would be "C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interace\Addons")
	* Delete all the SVUI_ folders
	* Go to the [SVUI-Temp project on GitHub](https://github.com/joev/SVUI-Temp)
	* Click the green "Clone or Download" button
	* Click "Download a ZIP" and save the ZIP wherever you like :) 
	* Open the ZIP and copy all the SVUI_ folders into your WoW Interface\Addons folder
	* Start WoW
	* Post bugs (yes, there are still plenty :>) here: https://github.com/joev/SVUI-Temp/Issues
